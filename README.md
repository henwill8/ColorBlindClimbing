# ColorBlindClimbing
Highlights holds of a color so that climbers (mainly for indoor bouldering) can differentiate between routes without awkwardly walking up to someone and asking them what color it is. I myself am not colorblind so its a bit hard to test what is needed.
# todo

    - Make more accurate between different hold hues
- Saturation and value use bounds function but without flat stopping
- Actual ui
