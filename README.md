# ColorBlindClimbing
Highlights holds of a color so that climbers (mainly for indoor bouldering) can differentiate between routes without awkwardly walking up to someone and asking them what color it is. I myself am not colorblind so its a bit hard to test what is needed.
# todo
- Colorsets? (automatically or manually choose?) (would create value sets to choose from when selecting hold, might fix dual tech not being highlighted and also general badness)
- Actual ui
- Make it actually work well for people who did not create it
- Tutorial to teach about creating colorsets and stuff?
