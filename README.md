# ColorBlindClimbing
Highlights holds of a color so that climbers (mainly for indoor bouldering) can differentiate between routes without awkwardly walking up to someone and asking them what color it is. I myself am not colorblind so its a bit hard to test what is needed.
# todo
- Colorsets? (automatically or manually choose?) (would create value sets to choose from when selecting hold, might fix dual tech not being highlighted and also general badness)
- Global color saves
    - Save every set with the max value being scaled down to a semi small value and then add it, create boundaries from created array
    - Creates some sort of past accuracy, sorts between similar colors better?
    - Maybe override values that arent extreme to get rid of layering (average values that are above the midpoint?)
- Actual ui
- Make it actually work well for people who did not create it
- Tutorial to teach about creating colorsets and stuff?
